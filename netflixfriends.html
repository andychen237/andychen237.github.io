                        <h2><b><p style="color:#E50914">PROBLEM SPACE</p></b></h2>
						<p>Whether it’s going to the movie theater or gathering together around the TV, 
                            watching movies and television is largely an experience that is enjoyed collectively. 
                            However, with streaming 
                            platforms becoming the main mode to watch movies nowadays, one glaring 
                            omission within most of these platforms is the ability to watch movies and shows with friends 
                            online. Usually, third-party programs are needed to be able to achieve this, and these 
                            programs often require payment or are even prohibited from working
                            with several streaming services because of restrictions related to copyright and licensing. 
                            The goal of this assignment is to integrate the social experience of watching entertainment into 
                            the most popular streaming platform, Netflix, 
                            by creating a feature where one can interact and watch movies and shows with friends. </p>

							<h2><b><p style="color:#E50914">CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY</p></b></h2>
						</header>
						<p>I conducted a contextual inquiry to better understand what is lacking in the
                            social experience of Netflix, with a specific focus on how users would currently use the
                            Netflix platform to watch movies with friends online.
                            The user for our contextual inquiry is a student in our class, 
                            Cameron Franz, who frequently uses Netflix and also has used it to watch movies/shows with friends online.
                            The single task he was given was deceptively straightforward: simply try to watch a movie on Netflix together with a 
                            friend virtually (in this instance, the friend, Reem Larabi, was also in the room with us and she's also in this class). 
                            Why this task might not be as straightforward as it appears is that there is no way to accomplish this task within the Netflix UI itself 
                            because of the unavailability of this feature. Therefore, this is a rather open-ended task that could
                            be done in a number of ways and with this in mind, I was curious on how Cameron would approach this task.
                            <br>

                            <br>The first thing he did was set up a Facetime call with Reem. This
                            actually proved to be quite inconvenient because this required opening a separate window and 
                            trying to split the screen between the streaming video and the Facetime call.

                            <br><figure>
                                <img src="images/screenshotone.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /><br>
                            </figure>
                            <br>

                            Then, Cameron logged onto twoseven.xyz, which is a website that allows friends to watch movies together. 
                            I've never used this website before, but Cameron having prior experience using it definitely
                            made the task a lot easier for him. However, he had to install an additional Chrome extension to use the Netflix feature, and had to coordinate with
                            Reem to make sure she also had it installed. 
                        
                            <br><figure>
                                <br><img src="images/screenshottwo.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /><br>
                            </figure>

                            <br><figure>
                                <img src="images/screenshotthree.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /><br>
                            </figure><br>

                            After installing the Chrome extension, the Netflix window on twoseven was stuck loading for a few minutes, 
                            and Cameron had to refresh multiple times before the page was properly shown. Eventually, the page
                            loaded and Cameron was able to 
                            invite Reem’s account and she was able to join the twoseven room.


                            <br><br><figure>
                                <img src="images/screenshotfour.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /><br>
                            </figure><br>

                            However, when a movie was picked by Cameron, both laptops were compared to see if the 
                            website was working properly. Unfortunately, the video was not in sync and 
                            there was lagging in the two laptops, with the video on one laptop being several 
                            seconds behind, or at some moments, completely not playing. To attempt to fix this problem,
                            Cameron attempted to pause his stream so Reem's could "catch up". However,
                             sometimes playing or pausing the video on one laptop did not play or pause it on 
                            the other, and other times it did. This unpredictable behavior made it even harder to fix the delay
                            between the two.

                        <section id="Five">
                            <header class="major">

                            <p><br>From the results of this task, it seems less than optimal to watch movies 
                            together this way. The interface felt clunky and setting up the movie and getting it 
                            started took quite some time. And even after doing so, the movie was not even 
                            functioning most of the time. Using twoseven made it hard to have a true shared experience,
                            especially since the streams were asynchronous. <br><br>To be able to 
                            successfully watch movies together on Netflix, one would have to experiment with and 
                            have knowledge of different third-party programs/extensions (twoseven and 
                            Netflix Party, for example), but even with these existing programs, they are not guaranteed to 
                            work. (Another example from past personal experience is when trying 
                            to share my Netflix screen in Zoom or Discord, the screen was blacked out because of 
                            copyright, so that is another method that would also not work.) The online reviews for 
                            these respective programs also indicate a lack of 
                            satisfaction with these methods — reviewers cite frequent disconnections, issues resulting from browser 
                            differences, and audio/video playback issues as reasons why attempting to watch 
                            movies online together on these services is a frustrating experience. <br><br>
                            
                            To organize the actions involved in the task and the resulting observations/interpretations, a sequential model was made
                            using Miro. 
                            The breakdowns helped generate many ideas for possible solutions and created much room for 
                            opportunity to improve upon what’s currently out there.<br><br>

							<h2><b><p style="color:#E50914">PROTOTYPE</p></b></h2>
						</header>
						<p>With the ideas of the sequential model in mind, I 
                            did my prototyping on Figma to best replicate what I envisioned would make for a better social experience on Netflix. 
                            (Just for fun, I also made the Netflix selections some of 
                            my favorite horror movies since it's October!) <br><br>

                            <i>Note: I know this does deviate from some of the other assignments in that it 
                                doesn’t redesign/improve upon an existing functionality within a website
                                but adds a whole entire new functionality altogether (but I guess 
                                I am technically redesigning the current ways one would watch a movie with a friend)</i>
                            <br><br>
                            Below are the features I implemented in the prototype, along with a gif demo: <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>FEATURES:</strong><br>

                            <i><b>Invite a friend to a movie/request to join a friend’s movie</b></i><br>
                            To add someone to a movie, one can simply click the 
                            “Netflix and Chill” icon while viewing a movie, and this will 
                            direct the user to their friend list. There, one can invite 
                            the friend to a movie, or join a friend’s movie if possible. 
                            Whatever option that is picked sends a request to the friend, 
                            and if accepted, the friends can watch the film together 
                            using video/voice/text chat. Having all of this within the Netflix interface 
                            fixes the problem of having to download buggy third party programs and 
                            use separate windows for communication services (video/voice/text messaging).
                            <br><br>

                            <figure>

                            </figure>
                            <br>

                            <i><b>Netflix Friend List</b></i><br>
                            The friend list features the online status of each user, 
                            their current activity, and a user-inputted status. 
                            The ability to see what others are watching was inspired by the Spotify feature that allows users to see what their friends are currently listening to. Within this friend list also includes a list of recommendations from friends.
                            <br><br>

                            <i><b>Netflix recommendations</b></i><br>
                            Watching movies is a shared experience, and to facilitate the social aspect of movie-watching, an option to recommend movies to fellow friends is another feature on this prototype. To do this, one simply has to go to their friend list and click the button “Send a recommendation”, which will prompt the user to pick which friend to recommend a movie to 
                            and what movie they want to recommend.
